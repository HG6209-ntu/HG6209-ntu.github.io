# Learning Objectives

## Python/Programming

This category is for programming concepts, techniques, and structures as used in Python.

### The `re` Module

#### `re.search()`

#### `re.match()`

#### `re.fullmatch()`

#### `re.sub()`

### Built-in Functions

#### `map()`

#### `filter()`

## NLP/CL

This category is for concepts and techniques related to natural language processing or computational linguistics.

### String Manipulation

#### Stemming and Lemmatization

*   What is the difference?
*   When would you use one or the other?

#### Segmentation and Tokenization

*   What is the difference (i.e., when is segmentation not tokenization)

### N-grams

#### N-grams

*   What is an n-gram?
*   Why do we pad sequences when computing n-grams?
*   How do you get n-grams of a sequence (using NLTK or just Python)?

#### Collocations

*   What are collocations?
*   What are they good for?

#### N-gram Language Models

*   What can you do with an n-gram language model?
*   What is the formula for a bigram model? (at least, in general terms)

### Part-of-Speech Tags

#### Part-of-Speech Tags

*   What are tag sets? Why are there different ones?
*   Do all languages use the same tag set?

#### Tagging Methods

### Machine Learning and Classification

#### Statistical Inference

*   What are the basic requirements for statistical inference?
*   Create a basic model for predicting, e.g., gender, part-of-speech, next words, etc.

#### Automatic Evaluation

*   Why do we use automatic evaluation?
*   How would you evaluate, e.g., a part-of-speech tagger?

#### Backoff Methods

*   What makes a good backoff method?
*   Why do we use backoff methods?

#### Baseline Systems

*   What makes a good baseline system?
*   Why do we use baseline systems?

#### Machine Learning

#### Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

*   What is necessary for supervised classification?

#### Linguistic Features for Machine Learning

*   Give examples of linguistic features for tasks like POS-tagging, genre classification, etc.

#### Classification

*   What is the classification task?
*   What are some examples?

#### Decision Trees

*   In general terms, how is a decision tree created?
*   How is it applied to classify some new instance?

#### Entropy

*   What is the formula for entropy?
*   What does it measure?

#### Ethics

*   Can you describe and give examples of the following kinds of problems?
    *   exclusion
    *   overgeneralization
    *   overexposure / underexposure
    *   dual-use

## Software Engineering

This category is for practices of software engineering as well as programming concepts that are relevant to programming languages beyond Python.

### Regular Expressions

### Advanced Functions

#### Higher-order Functions

#### Recursive Functions
