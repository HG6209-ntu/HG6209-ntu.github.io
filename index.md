abstract: >
  Traditionally linguistic analysis was done largely by hand, but
  computer-based methods and tools are becoming increasingly widely
  used in contemporary research. This course provides an introduction
  to skills and resources to assist the linguist in performing
  fast, flexible, and accurate quantitative analyses. Students will
  learn a programming language (Python) along with techniques for
  processing human language data. No previous programming experience
  is required: we will teach you the basics of programming and
  computational linguistics along with some good software engineering
  practices.
