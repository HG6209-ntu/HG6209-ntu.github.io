<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This project constitutes 30% of your final grade for HG2051. Please
work on the final program and report individually. Your code will be
assessed based on its functionality and simplicity/efficiency.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your programming
and reasoning abilities by working on a problem individually. If you
have an idea for another project that you would like to do instead, talk
to me for approval.</p></li>
<li><p>This project involves sorting and developing lexical resources
for multiple languages. Submission requirements include your data,
output, and annotated code along with a short writeup describing your
goals, process, and results.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="project-1-machine-translation">Project 1: Machine
translation</h2>
<p>Machine translation involves automatically translating from one
language to another. While automated translation systems have increased
in complexity in recent years, you will be creating and evaluating a
simple Python tool, using a bilingual dictionary to translate text from
one language to another.</p>
<h3 id="organize-your-data">Organize your data</h3>
<p>The first step in developing a translation tool is finding texts that
can be used to validate it. For this we need “parallel texts” in the
languages we want to translate between, i.e. texts that are “translation
equivalents” and ideally can be aligned.</p>
<h4 id="get-the-base-text-for-our-source-language">Get the base text for
our source language</h4>
<p>For this project we will use the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights as our base text, and our source language will be English. The
UDHR base text for English can be found <a
href="https://www.unicode.org/udhr/d/udhr_eng.txt">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="choose-your-target-language">Choose your target language</h4>
<p>Choose another UDHR text in a language other than English from the <a
href="https://www.unicode.org/udhr/translations.html">UDHR unicode
page</a>.</p>
<p>The language you choose should have a Latin-based script and be one
for which a dictionary is readily available (see below). For evaluation
purposes, you may want to choose a language that you have some
familiarity with, i.e. <a
href="https://www.unicode.org/udhr/d/udhr_fra.txt">French</a>.</p>
<h4 id="find-or-develop-a-bilingual-dictionary">Find or develop a
bilingual dictionary</h4>
<p>Next, find a bilingual dictionary resource that lists words in
English and their corresponding words in the non-English language you
chose. Some options can be found <a
href="https://www.dicts.info/uddl.php">here</a> but you may also want to
look for other sources or develop your own.</p>
<h3 id="translate-each-sentence-using-the-dictionary">Translate each
sentence using the dictionary</h3>
<p>Using your bilingual source (wordlist/dictionary), translate each
English sentence in your aligned text to the target language
word-by-word. Then translate each target language sentence into English
using the same resource. Your result should therefore be four times as
long as the original UDHR text, where each sentence/line has four
corresponding alignments: 1. the English sentence from the source text
2. the target language sentence from the target text 3. the
English-to-target translation 4. the target-to-English translation.</p>
<p>Evaluate the translation and consider how you can improve its
quality. See if you can write additional code that will improve the
quality of the translation.</p>
<h3 id="output">Output</h3>
<p>Your submission should include several text files and a writeup, more
details of which will be given in your individual GitHub repository. In
your writeup, consider the quality of the translations you were able to
achieve using a dictionary. Are there other methods you can think of
that would generate a better translation? How does this method of
translation compare with other machine translation systems like Google
Translate? How well does the UDHR text lend itself to translation? Are
there other kinds/genres of texts you could try where your machine
translator would perform better? (You can use these questions as a
starting point for your discussion)</p>
<h2 id="bonus">Bonus</h2>
<p>The NLTK library has a <code>comtrans</code> module that provides
machine learning tools for translation. You can use this module with an
aligned corpus to train a model to translate between a source and target
language. To receive additional credit for this project, use the aligned
UDHR texts that you created in the first part to train a translation
model. Then use that model to translate from the source to the target
text. This will require some research on your part to understand the
module and how to format your aligned texts appropriately.</p>
<p>Write this output to another text file containing the aligned English
sentences, target language sentences and the English-to-target
translations. In your PDF writeup, discuss how well it performs in
relation to your simpler dictionary-based translation, and consider
reasons why. Your writeup page limit is increased to 6 pages to allow
for the bonus discussion.</p>
