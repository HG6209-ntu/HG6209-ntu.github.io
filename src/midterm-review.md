# Learning Objectives

## Python/Programming

This category is for programming concepts, techniques, and structures as used in Python.

### Modes of Programming

Python is a very flexible language that can be used in multiple ways.

#### REPL

REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop) describes the way the computer operates an _interactive interpreter_ such as Python’s IDLE interpreter. The computer reads what the user entered, evaluates it, prints the output, and loops (starts this process again). When you see code written with `>>>` on the left side, it is showing what you would see in an interactive interpreter:

    >>> print("hello")
    hello

You can start an interactive interpreter by running the Python command in a terminal without any arguments:

    $ python
    Python 3.8.2 (default, Jul 16 2020, 14:00:26)
    [GCC 9.3.0] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>

The REPL mode of Python is useful for quick experiments and debugging, but it is not easy to revise what has been entered so it is not convenient for larger programs.

#### Module

Perhaps the most common way to write Python code is in a _module_. A module is just a `.py` file containing Python code. The file is saved on the computer and it is not run until it is loaded and processed by a Python process. Modules meant to be imported by other modules are generally called _libraries_, while modules meant to be run directly are called _scripts_. Imagine you had a file `hello.py` with the following contents:

    print('hello')

You can then run this script at the command line and see its output as follows (depending on your system and environment, the `python3` command may be `python`, `py`, or something else):

    $ python3 hello.py
    hello

Using modules to write Python code is the most versatile mode and is recommended for most uses.

#### Notebook

A mode of using Python popular for demostration or pegagogical purposes is the notebook. It mixes human language text with Python code and sometimes provides a more friendly view of the output (e.g., rendered charts and tables). This style of programming is called _literate programming_. It looks something like this:

### Expressions, Statements, Definitions

#### Assignment

    >>> x = 3            # assign the value 3 to the variable named 'x'
    >>> x = x + 1        # evaluate the expression 'x + 1' then assign its result to x
    >>> x
    4
    >>> x += 1           # shorthand for the above
    >>> x
    5
    >>> x = 'foo'        # variables can be reassigned to values of a different type
    >>> x.upper()        # an expression involving the variable does not change its value
    'FOO'
    >>> x
    'foo'
    >>> x = [1]          # ...
    >>> x.append(2)      # unless the value is mutable
    >>> x
    [1, 2]
    >>> x = x.append(3)  # be careful not to reassign to function that return None (don't do this)
    >>> x is None
    True

#### Functions

    def myfunction(x, y, z=0):  # define a function named 'myfunction' with 3 parameters;
                                # x and y are required, z has a default value so it is optional
        return x * y * z        # return a value so the caller can make use of it
                                # if there is no return statement, the function returns None

Once a function is defined, call it by its name:

    >>> myfunction(1, 2)
    0
    >>> myfunction(1, 2, 3)
    6

### Data Types

#### `int`

Integer types represent positive or negative whole numbers.

    >>> 1024           # literal integers are base-10
    1024
    >>> int(3.14159)   # int() casts floats to integers
    3
    >>> int('101')     # int() casts strings to integers
    101
    >>> int('101', 2)  # an explicit base can be given
    5
    >>> 20 // 3        # floor division drops any remainder
    6

#### `float`

Floating-point numbers represent numbers with a fractional component.

    >>> 3.14           # literal floats include a decimal
    3.14
    >>> 6.02e23        # and/or an exponent
    6.02e+23
    >>> float(3)       # float() casts from integers
    3.0
    >>> float('3.14')  # and strings (but only base-10)
    3.14
    >>> 20 / 3         # regular division results in a float
    6.666666666666667
    >>> 20 / 5         # even when there's no remainder
    4.0

#### `str`

Strings are sequences of characters.

    >>> 'a string'         # strings are surrounded by single quotes
    'a string'
    >>> "another string"   # or double quotes
    'another string'
    >>> '''yet
    ... another'''         # or three single/double quotes (newlines allowed)
    >>> 'もう一つ'          # unicode is ok
    'もう一つ'

**Useful string methods:**

*   [str.split()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split) – return the list of tokens in the string
*   [str.lower()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.lower) – return the string with all cased characters downcased

#### `list`

Lists are mutable sequences of values.

    >>> x = []           # make an empty list
    >>> x = list()       # this works, too
    >>> x.append(1)      # add a single value
    >>> x.extend([2,3])  # add multiple values
    >>> x
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> x[1:]            # slice from the 2nd element
    [2, 3]
    >>> x[:-1]           # slice until 1 before the last element
    [1, 2]
    >>> len(x)           # find how many elements are on the list
    3
    >>> x.count(3)       # count how many times a particular element occurs
    1
    >>> 4 in x           # use 'in' to check for membership
    False

#### `tuple`

Tuples are immutable sequences of values.

    >>> ()                       # make an empty tuple
    ()
    >>> tuple()                  # or use the function
    ()
    >>> (1)                      # but this doesn't work (it looks like an expression)
    1
    >>> 1, 2                     # use commas to create tuples in general
    (1, 2)
    >>> 1,                       # even for single items
    (1,)
    >>> (1, 2)                   # but often we need parentheses around them
    (1, 2)
    >>> x = tuple([1, 1, 2, 3])  # create tuples from an iterable
    >>> x[1:-1]                  # slicing works as expected
    (1, 2)
    >>> x.count(1)               # many list operations work on tuples (but not mutating ones)
    2

#### `set`

Sets are containers of unique values.

    >>> set()              # use the function to create an empty set ('{}' creates a dictionary)
    set()
    >>> {1, 2}             # Use braces with comma-separated values to create non-empty sets
    {1, 2}
    >>> {1, 1, 2, 3}       # repeated values are dropped
    {1, 2, 3}
    >>> x = {1, 2}
    >>> x | {3}            # | is the operator for set-union
    {1, 2, 3}
    >>> x & {2}            # & is the operator for set-intersection
    {2}
    >>> x.add(3)           # use add() to add a single value
    >>> x.update([3, 4])   # use update() to add multiple values (duplicates still dropped)
    >>> x
    {1, 2, 3, 4}
    >>> 2 in x             # check for membership
    True

#### `dict`

Dictionaries are much like sets but they associate keys to values.

    >>> {}                          # create an empty dict with {}
    {}
    >>> dict()                      # the function works, too
    {}
    >>> {'a': 1, 'b': 2}            # keys ('a' and 'b') map to values (1, 2)
    {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
    >>> d = {'a': 1}
    >>> d['b'] = 2                  # assign a single key to a value
    >>> d.update({'c': 3, 'd': 4})  # update() to assign multiple keys to values
    >>> d['c']                      # retrieve the value associated with a key
    3
    >>> d['b'] = 1                  # keys are unique; here 'b' is reassigned
    >>> d                           # but values need not be unique
    {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}
    >>> len(d)                      # len() gets the number of keys
    4
    >>> list(d)                     # list(d) returns the list of keys
    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
    >>> 'b' in d                    # check for membership of keys
    True
    >>> 1 in d                      # cannot check for membership of values this way
    False

### Constants

A constant is a special type of variable whose value cannot be changed. However,
we don't really use constants in Python since any variable can be reassigned.
It is good to know, however, which variable names (like 'list', 'dict', etc..)
should be avoided so you don't accidentally reassign key functions. Naming
constant variables in all capital letters is a convention to separate them from
ordinary variables, however, it does not actually prevent reassignment.

#### True & False

Boolean operators that identify values.

#### None

An operator that identifies presence/absence.

### Control Structures

#### if

An `if` statement is used for a _conditional block_—code that is executed only if a condition is true. See the Python Tutorial’s section on [`if` Statements](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements).

Only one thing below will be printed:

```python
    word = 'Dog'
    if word in vocabulary:
        print(word, 'exists in the vocabulary')
    elif word.lower() in vocabulary:
        print(word, 'exists in vocabulary when case-normalized')
    else:
        print(word, 'does not exist in vocabulary')
```

Note that if you use multiple `if` statements instead of `elif` or `else`, they will be attempted regardless of whether the previous conditions were true. In the following, both will print if both `'Dog'` and `'dog'` are in the vocabulary.

```python
    word = 'Dog'
    if word in vocabulary:
        print(word, 'exists in the vocabulary')
    if word.lower() in vocabulary:
        print(word, 'exists in vocabulary when case-normalized')
```

#### for

A `for` statement (also called a for-loop) loops over each item in an iterable. This generally means the loop is bounded by the number of items in the iterable, and it’s used when the iterable items themselves are used inside the loop. See the Python Tutorial’s section on [`for` Statements](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements).

```python
    numbers = [1, 2, 3]
    for number in numbers:
        square = number**2
        print(f'the square of {number} is {square}')
```

#### while

A `while` statement (also called a while-loop) loops as long as a condition is met. This condition can be just about anything, and sometimes it is `True`, meaning an infinite loop. See the Python Tutorial’s example of [`while` statements](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#first-steps-towards-programming). While-loops are often used when the number of iterations is not fixed or known in advance, or when there is no iterable whose items are used inside the loop.

```python
    # print Fibonacci numbers less than 100
    a = 0
    b = 1
    while a < 100:
        print(a)
        tmp = b  # temporary variable for the old value of b
        b = b + a
        a = tmp
```

### Pandas

**Pandas** is a library for working with dataframes, a table-like structure
that allows for rapid calculations. It also helps us to organize data into a
human-readable structure. You can used Pandas by importing it and initializing
a dataframe:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame()
```

You can also use pandas to read and write character-delimited files or excel
spreadsheets:

```python
df = pd.read_csv('randomfile.csv', delimiter="\t")
df = pd.to_csv('randomfile.csv', sep="\t")

df = pd.read_excel('randomfile.xlsx')
df = pd.to_excel('randomfile.xlsx')
```
