title: Using Visual Studio Code
---

## Getting Started

There is a wealth of introductory information available at
<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/>, including guides and videos.

In addition, when you start Visual Studio Code and get the welcome
screen, there's a "Learn" section with some interactive ways to learn
about the program from within the program.

For the purposes of our workflow, we will make use of three elements: the
<mark style="background-color: pink">**file explorer**</mark>, the
<mark style="background-color: lightgreen">**editor**</mark>, and the
<mark style="background-color: lightblue">**terminal**</mark>. By the end of
the course you should be comfortable moving between these elements to develop
your code.

![*Three elements of the development environment*](static/dev-environment.png){ width=100% }

### File explorer

This is where your programming files are located, along with various subfolders
for organizational purposes. When you set up your environment you created a
virtual environment (`env` in the image above) which is essentially a
subfolder that stores all the libraries and packages you use in your code.
You should not need to access this subfolder, so you can ignore it. You will
create subfolders for each of your homework assignments and projects, however,
so it's good to be aware of how the <mark style="background-color:
pink">**file explorer**</mark> is organized.

### Editor

When you open a file to work on, it opens in your <mark
style="background-color: lightgreen">**editor**</mark>, which allows you to
write/modify code. Visual Studio Code, like many editors, can recognize the
syntax/commands of various programming languages. If your file is saved with
a `.py` extension, it will recognize the file as being written in the Python
programming language and will provide various colors and highlighting that
makes the code easier to read and debug. The line numbers are also helpful
for allowing you to find errors quickly when you are running your code.

### Terminal

After saving your work (<kbd>Ctrl-s</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd-s</kbd>), the
<mark style="background-color: lightblue">**terminal**</mark>
is where you can run the file. This is also known as the "command line
interface" (CLI) since it is used for running commands. As you type commands,
notice the prefix that precedes them, composed of 3 parts separated by spaces
in the screenshot above.

1. The first part `(env)` identifies that the virtual environment is active.
This should always be the case when you are running code. The environment was
activated by the command `source env/bin/activate`.
2. The second part is the name of the user and the name of the computer being
used.
3. The third part `HG2051` is the name of the folder (location) where the
commands are being run.

The command line or <mark style="background-color: lightblue">
**terminal**</mark> is where you will run your code to check that
it functions. To run a Python file, simply type the command `python` (or
`python3`) followed by a space and the name of the python script (typing the
extension is optional). To speed things up, you are usually able to simply
type the first few characters of the name of the script and use the <kbd>Tab</kbd>
key to autocomplete it. Then press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Return</kbd> to
run the script. If there are no errors, you will see nothing in the terminal
unless you have written `print()` statements into the code.

Going back and forth between each of these elements of your development
environment gives you immediate feedback and allows you to catch errors
in order to fix them and achieve working code. We will be following this
workflow throughout the course to improve as coders.

If you are still unclear on how these elements are connected, a good overview
can be found [here](https://faculty.washington.edu/otoomet/info201-book/command-line.html) -
this overview starts with the terminal or command line and explains how to use
commands to navigate your folder structure. 

## The Command Palette

One additional feature I would like to point out in VSCode is the "command
palette", which is opened by <kbd>F1</kbd> on all platforms, or <kbd>Ctrl-Shift-P</kbd>
on Windows/Linux or <kbd>⇧⌘P</kbd> on macOS, or via the menu *View* >
*Command Palette*. This acts like a search of menu items and allows
access to some features not in the menus. In particular, when you have a
Python interpreter selected, you can search for "Python: Create
Terminal" (or some abbreviation, e.g., `pyterm` is probably sufficient),
which opens a terminal with the appropriate virtual environment already
active. Another useful command is "Python: Configure Tests", which helps
you setup `pytest` for testing your code. Since we are primarily using the
terminal, we will not be spending much time using the command palette, but
it is a good thing to be aware of as you develop your coding skills.

## Accepting Assignments

When you receive a link to accept a new homework assignment, you will be
directed to GitHub and it will give you the URL of your newly created
project. Now we can download ("clone") the repository. From the project
page, copy the URL of the Git repository via the green "Code" button:

![*Copy the Repository URL*](static/github-git-url.png){ width=100% }

Now go to Visual Studio Code and select the terminal. Make sure that your
location is the HG2051 base directory that you created earlier. Type the command
`git clone` followed by a space, and then <kbd>Ctrl-v</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd-v</kbd>
to paste in the URL, then <kbd>Enter</kbd>. This will "clone" your project
into a subdirectory of your current directory, and allow you to push any
saved/committed changes to the online repository.

![*Clone the Repository*](static/vscode-git-clone.png){ width=100% }

Once it has downloaded, you'll see its folder in the explorer sidebar.
Visual Studio Code should ask if you wish to open the folder or add it
to the current workspace. Please choose "Open" or "Open in New Window".
Please do *not* choose "Add to Workspace" as that will complicate our
setup (it activates a feature called "multi-root workspaces" which we
are not using).

## Working on Assignments

With an assignment cloned and its folder opened in Visual Studio Code,
ensure that your virtual environment for the course is activated. Follow
the instructions for [creating a virtual environment](environment-setup.html#virtual-environment)
if you have not done so. When you're done, you should see `(env)` at the
beginning of the terminal window prompt if it has been activated. If not,
activate it using the activation command for your operating system, ensuring
that you do so from the base HG2051 directory you created earlier. Now navigate
to your assignment folder using the `cd [assignment-subfolder]` command in
the terminal to change directories.

At this point you should install the dependencies:

```{.bash .terminal}
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set up Visual Studio Code for testing by opening the command palette and
searching for "Python: Configure Tests". For the testing framework,
select "pytest". For the testing location, choose `.` (root directory).
If successful, you will see a beaker icon on the left. When you click
that icon, you'll get to the testing view. Click the
"double-green-triangle" icon at the top of this view to run all tests.
If any failed, the filenames will appear with a red "X" in a circle.
Clicking on such a filename shows you the tests that failed in the
editor area. Hovering over a red-squiggly line on the failed test will
show you the exact error message.

![*Using Visual Studio Code to Run Tests*](static/testing.png)

To complete your assignment, edit the code in the main Python files
(e.g., `hw1.py`) and run the tests again until more or all of them pass.
When you're satisfied, you can proceed to submit the assignment.

Do **not** edit the given test files (e.g., `hw1_test.py`). Changing the
tests instead of the code may constitute academic dishonesty and can
have severe consequences. However, it is acceptable and even encouraged
that you augment the tests with your own. You should create a separate
file for this, just ensure it has `_test.py` in the name, such as
`my_test.py`.

## Submitting Assignments

When you've saved some files in your assignment, you'll notice the SCM
icon (a Git graph with 3 nodes on the left) has a number in a circle
indicating how many files have been modified. This is a visual way of
identifying and committing changes in your repository. However, we will
focus first on understanding the terminal commands related to Git (we
will cover this in the first few classes).

For now, after you've made some changes and saved your file, type the
command `git status`. This will show you what has changed in your current
directory's contents, including subfolders. To have Git update any files
you first need to *add* them to the tracker using `git add [name-of-file]`
and then *commit* all your added files with a message that reminds you
of your changes using `git commit -m "your message here"` (don't forget the
quotes). You can also simply type `git add .` to add all the changes in a
directory at once. You are then ready to update the online repository with
the command `git push`.
